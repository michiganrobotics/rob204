# Robotics 204: Introduction to Human Robot Systems
[ROB 204](https://robotics.umich.edu/academics/courses/course-offerings/rob-204-winter-2022/) is an introductory course for robotics majors that provides a foundation for designing robotic systems to address a user need with a sociotechnical context. The course combines lectures, labs, and discussions to teach and reinforce learning objectives in an equitable and experiential manner. The main learning objectives of this course are to teach students how to ideate robotic system designs, infer how a person should interact with that system and characterize their influence on its design, and assess the overall system with end users. 

The first iteration of this course was offered in Fall 2022. 

## Labs 
Labs are split into two phases––the first, which are hands-on learning activities intended to teach students about core HRI fundamentals. A brief description of each lab can be seen below. The second phase is a detailed usability study, where students perform stakeholder interviews to learn about the socially-engaged design. As no hardware and software are required for these labs, they will  be omitted from this description.

### Lab 1/2 - User Interface Control Input Design Labs 
Description: The learning objectives of this lab are to equip students with the skills necessary to design and evaluate a user interface to support a robotic task, implement different types of direct input controls for robotic systems, and investigate the role of perception in interface design.

Necessary Hardware: 
- Arduino Uno
- Custom Shield 
- x3 Linear Potentiometers
- x3 Rotary Encoders 
- x3 Buttons 
- x1 Switch
- Velcro and Base board to mount peripherals to
- 3d printed housings
  
### Lab 3/4 - Non-verbal Human-Robot Communication Labs
Description: The goal of this lab is to teach students about non-verbal communication by implementing a posture-based control pipeline on a robot, compare and contrast the effect of adding robot control states on the system usability, and critique design decisions for a non-verbal communication strategy. 

Necessary Hardware: 
- Raspberry Pi 
- Servo Motor 
- Raspberry Pi Camera
- 3d printed housings & mounts, PVC Pipe, Board to block view 
- Morse Code Sheets
  
### Lab 5/6 - Human Mental Models and Robot Hierarchical Control Labs 
Description: The main objectives of this lab are to develop a mental model of a robotic system and evaluate it, describe the importance of calibrated trust in automated systems, compare and contrast operating a robot at different levels of control, and evaluate when certain levels of control are more appropriate than others. 

Necessary Hardware: 
- Amazon Astro
- PVC Pipe and Plastic Walls
